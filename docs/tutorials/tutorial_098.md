# Tutorial 098: Verifiable Federated Learning

This tutorial introduces the concept of ensuring clients computed what they said they did.

## Concepts

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)**: Client proves $y = f(x)$ without revealing $x$.
- **TEEs**: Trusted Execution Environments (SGX).

## Simulation

Stub out a `Verifier` component that accepts `Proof` objects.

## Exercises

1. Computational cost of ZK-SNARKs for neural networks.
2. Trusted hardware assumptions.
