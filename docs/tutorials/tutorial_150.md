# Tutorial 150: Future Directions in FL

This tutorial surveys emerging trends in federated learning.

## Trends

1. **Foundation Models**: Federated fine-tuning of LLMs.
2. **Decentralized FL**: Peer-to-peer without central server.
3. **Federated Analytics**: Beyond ML (statistics, queries).
4. **On-device Learning**: Continuous adaptation.
5. **Federated LLMs**: Privacy-preserving language models.

## Open Challenges

- Efficiency at scale.
- Theoretical convergence guarantees.
- Privacy-utility trade-offs.

## Exercises

1. Research roadmap for your FL project.
2. Identifying high-impact open problems.
